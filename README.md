# Olympic Medalist Dashboard

This project is designed to receive a JSON file containing data on Olympic athletes, their respective countries, and the medals they've won. The goal is to provide a clear, comprehensive display of each countryâ€™s medal totals (gold, silver, and bronze), as well as the overall total. Additionally, the project will show each athlete and their respective medal count for their country.

## Features

- Display each country with totals for gold, silver, and bronze medals.
- Provide an overall total of medals for each country.
- List all athletes from each country, along with their individual medal count.

## Project Objectives

The primary aim of this project is to showcase:

1. **Clear, self-documenting code**: Code should be easy to understand and maintain without excessive comments. Variables, functions, and classes should have names that indicate their purpose.
2. **Concise variable and function naming**: Avoid long or confusing names, ensuring readability and clarity.
3. **Best practices in file structure**: Ensure logical separation of concerns with a clear folder structure for models, views, controllers, and utilities.
4. **Testing**: Include unit tests to ensure that key functionality is thoroughly tested and reliable.
